# MODGO

MODGO is a *golinks* engine. Golinks are short, memorable phrases that can be used to access common resources.

This is a protype version of MODGO, built to identify areas for focus and choose promising technologies. It was also a good chance to learn Docker / Docker Compose.

MODGO can be run with `docker compose up`.
